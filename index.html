    <h2>Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Concerned about content availability, general accessibility, and mobile browser capabilities, a new strategy for web creation was needed--one that concentrated on the content while doing more than simply paid service to older devices. 
    Both gentle decline and progressive improvement assess how well a site performs in a variety of browsers and devices. Getting into the progressive enhancement mindset is straightforward: simply think from the content out. 
    If you like sweets, think of it like a Peanut M&M. Chocolatey Layers of Progressive Enhancement. Begin with your content peanut, which is marked up in rich, semantic HTML. Cover the content with a layer of rich, creamy CSS. 
    Finally, add JavaScript as the hard candy shell to create a delicious delicacy.</p>
    <p>Some people prefer peanuts; in fact, some choose peanuts over Peanut M&Ms. Similarly, some people desire only the substance.
    To provide these people with a basic experience, make sure your markup conveys as much detail about the material it wraps around as possible.
    With its numerous interaction capabilities, as well as its ability to change and interact with the content and presentation layers, JavaScript is truly the component that can bring a site together to create a "experience."
    I'm not sure how the hard candy shell is added to an M&M, but incorporating JavaScript-based functionality and interactivity into your websites is simple when you consider progressive enhancement.

    <h2>Dragon Project Feedback and Reflection</h2>
    <p>I received feedback on my first attempt at creating micro-site projects for Project Dragon. The feedback indicated that there were minor details that needed to be changed, such as the background image not matching the font style and color of the text, and not being attention-grabbing enough. There were also issues with margins and padding, which left white spaces on the sides of the body, making the background image appear distorted. These issues were resolved by setting the margin and padding properties to zero. Additionally, a registration form was added to all pages to enable viewers to join the SpaceX club.</p>
    <p>On page 1, the font size and color of the text were not clear and did not contrast well with the background image. To fix this, the background image was changed, the text size was increased and the color was changed to improve visibility.</p>
    <p>On page 2, the background image lacked detail, making it difficult to see the hover property. The images for the post were also not properly aligned, so they were modified to ensure all three were identical in size. The background image was changed to include more detail, and the hover color was adjusted for better visibility.</p>
    <p>On page 3, the background image, the background of the table, and the color of the text were changed to improve the overall appearance and readability of the page.</p>
    <p>On page 4, a background was added, and the images were placed properly, while the text color was also adjusted. Additional padding was added to all the pages to improve the overall appearance of the pages.</p>
    <p>These changes made the pages look better, more detailed, and easier to read.</p>
